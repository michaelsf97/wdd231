        <h3> History of Trycicle </h3>

        <p> The trycicle is a <span><strong>three-wheel</strong></span> machine who helps people in short distances. 
        Our history is beginning to be written in the past when the owner Michael Smith Saavedra Forero is the owner, when he was a child his parents purchased a trycicle when he rode that too many times.
        yes, too many times, and when he the first time needed to go to a urgency to the bathroom, he tried to take a bus but it was almost 20 minutes ballpark. And it cost sorrounding <span><strong>$3.50 USD</strong></span>. Then, i bear in mind to take a transmilenio which was largest transport here, 
        then, it seems almost 30 minutes ballpark due to then to get out he would need to walk a little bit. Then a taxi, but it takes too much time.
        Finally, an informal <span><strong>trycicle</strong></span> driver offered him a route to, and then, he arrived in 10 minutes ballpark in front of his house and then it was shortest distance by 5 blocks and it costs <span><strong>$2 USD.</strong></span>
        At that time i thought, why not an app for this informal machine who really helps too much when you need to go short distances, 5 to 10 blocks.
